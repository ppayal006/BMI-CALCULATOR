# BMI-CALCULATOR
The BMI Calculator project aims to design and develop a user-friendly application that calculates an individual's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight. The application will provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to input their height and weight, and then display their corresponding BMI category.(underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese).
